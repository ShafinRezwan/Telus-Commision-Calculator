# Telus-Commision-Calculator
A Commission Calculator for Telus sales agents to use to track their sales. I came up with this project as a sales agent for Telus. It came to me when I was dealing with the frustrations of missing commisions on my paychecks, and not having a convinent way of tracking my orders I decided to create this tracker. Prior to this sales agents were tracking their sales on excel sheets manually.
